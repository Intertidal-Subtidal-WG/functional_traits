This script does imputation from the functional traits csvs with mice.
This differs from previous scripts in that it doesn't make a dissimilarity matrix, cluster, or do any further analysis. It simply removes NAs by imputing traits with their most probable replacement.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(mice)
library(here)

# here filepaths


```

```{r loadin}
#be sure to use na.strings or imputation will fail!
animal_trait_raw <- read.csv(here("data", '20220320_shoals_animal_traits.csv'), 
                      na.strings = c("","NA", 'N/A')) %>% filter(!(is.na(species)))

# algae traits not ready
#algae_trait_raw <- read.csv(here("data", '20220320_shoals_algae_traits.csv'), 
#                      na.strings = c("","NA", 'N/A')) %>% filter(!(is.na(species)))
```
